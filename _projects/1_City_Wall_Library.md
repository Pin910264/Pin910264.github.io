Performing Daily Life Along The City Wall at The City Wall Library. When we stand between the back lanes and the city wall, we realize ourselves being both an individual and a collective. When walking on the borders of the city, the city wall becomes a significant distinction. The relationship between ourselves and society and the surrounding environment is allocated. This wall was once the boundary between the inside and the outside of the city, and also as the boundary between land and sea. Various forces on the boundary disturbed each other, showing a dynamic relationship of the spatial sequence from inside to outside of the city.
