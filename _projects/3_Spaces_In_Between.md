I use "the space between man and water" as the medium to demonstrate the contemporary "relationship between man and water" here.

The city and the sea collide with the civilization and development of Kaohsiung, the port city, and the spatial characteristics of water in this city have also changed over time. What used to be a network is now simplified to four linear rivers. The over-simplified water system creates a kind of fracture experience and causes flood problems in cities.

After overlaying the maps of ancient and modern water systems, it is found that the new flood detention ponds are mostly located in the former Gupi pond, and the intersection of the new interception station and the Aihe River is mostly where the former Caogongzhen tributary was located.
