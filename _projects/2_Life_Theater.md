George Town Waterfront Redevelopment - Life Theater
My concept of this project is “Life Theater”. As a World Heritage Site, George Town has a lot of valuable day-to-day life. However, when we visited George Town, I found that tourists took up all the space, and the local people became tourists in their own city.Therefore, we want to create a “Life Theater” here, to make invisible into visible.
